Thus I made this starterkit following the absolute best examples and practices I gained from a portion of the bigger codebase and awesome engineers I've gotten an opportunity to work with ðŸ™Œ 

The primary reason for this archive is to give an adaptable "batteries included" full stack starterkit which follows great design designs (may be stubborn) and code decoupling which gets critical as the undertaking develops or new engineers are onboarded
